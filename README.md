# python-mini-projects

A collection of small Python projects I created while learning the basics of programming.  
Each one helped me practice concepts like user input, conditionals, and randomness.

##  Projects

###  Magic 8 Ball
Ask the magic 8 ball a question and get a randomly chosen response.

> **Concepts used:** `input`, `random.choice`, conditionals

File: `magic-8-ball.py`

---

###  Hogwarts House Sorter
Find out which Hogwarts house you belong to! Randomly assigns a house from the Harry Potter universe.

> **Concepts used:** `print`, `random`, `if/else`, strings

File: `sorting-hat.py`

---

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

### bash
python magic-8-ball.py
python sorting-hat.py
